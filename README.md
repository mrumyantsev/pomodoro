## How to work using the Pomodoro Technique?

1. Open the application in your browser and keep it as the first tab. (You'll still need to use the browser while you work.)
2. Start a timer for 25 minutes when you decide to start working.
3. Work focused, without distractions, until the timer rings.
4. When the timer rings, stop your creative work and take a short break (5-10 minutes).
5. Repeat steps 2-4 as long as you need to get work done. Take a longer break (20-30 minutes) after every 4 pomodori are done.

## Features
